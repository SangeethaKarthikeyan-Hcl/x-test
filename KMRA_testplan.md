### Test Summary

Key Management Reference Application (KMRA) is a proof-of-concept software created to demonstrate the integration of Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX) asymmetric key
capability with a hardware security model (HSM) on a centralized key server. 
This reference application sets up a NGINX workload to access the private key in an Intel® SGX enclave on a 3rd Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processor, 
using the Public-Key Cryptography Standard (PKCS) #11 interface and OpenSSL.
